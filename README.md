# Design System with React and Storybook

A **design system** is a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns.

**Why design systems matter?**
Design systems allow companies to define their own brand identity and bake it into accessible, consistent, and re-usable components, and this comes with many benefits.
